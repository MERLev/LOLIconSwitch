# LOLIconSwitch
This application can be used for fast enabling/disabling of LOLIcon plugin and restarts vita.

As current version of LOLIcon has some problems with Adrenaline, this app can bu used to turn it off and back on in a simple way.
You need to have ur0:/tai/lolicon.skprx for this app to work. When disabled, it would be renamed to ur0:/tai/lolicon_DISABLED.skprx
